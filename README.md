It is now Christmas Season once again! Are you excited to celebrate Christmas once again with your family? To have some quality time with our loved ones, the gifts to receive, or rather the cooking of Noche Buena? Here in the Philippines, September is considered the first month of the Christmas Season. Are you excited to celebrate Christmas once again with your family? Each region has its traditions and culture.

ATENEO DE NAGA UNIVERSITY JUINOR HIGHSCHOOL is one of the prestigious CATHOLIC schools here in Km. 7, Pacol Naga City, Camarines Sur. "Enot sa Gabos, Kahadean nin Diyos!" And because we serve first the Kingdom of God, we start each month with a mass. Last September 2023, we conducted a Living Holy Rosary after the celebration of Penafrancia Fiesta. It is our daily tradition here in our dear school, to formally start and welcome the Birth of our Savior- Jesus Christ. We also conducted Parish Services and a Donation Drive to share our blessings with our dear Brothers and Sisters outside.
